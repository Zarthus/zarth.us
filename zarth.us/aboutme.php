				<h3>Who am I anyways?</h3>
				<p>
					I'm Zarthus, but am also known as BuuGhost, or even Jos Ahrens off the internet, I'm from the Netherlands and currently study Software Engineering at the Alfa College in Groningen.
				</p><p>
					I enjoy programming in various languages, as of right now I am most proficient with PHP, I know a little bit of C# and Java, and am also mildly familiar with the C language.
					Currently I'm attempting to learn the C++ language. Recently I have also become rather skilled with Regular Expressions.
				</p><p>
					In relation to music, I enjoy all sorts, but most of the genres I listen to are rock, metal, 80s, and 70s music.
					You can check out what I've recently listened to by checking my last fm account <a href="http://last.fm/user/BuuGhost">BuuGhost</a>, or by checking my <a href="http://open.spotify.com/user/1155290200/playlist/4QXARDBPRoe99fObf6e6db">spotify playlist</a>
				</p><p>
					As for languages that don't relate to programming, I natively speak Dutch, and have learnt a great portion of English over the years, starting at the age of 11.
					I know a little bit of German in addition to that, as for Spanish, I can usually read a little bit of it, but cannot write or speak it.

					<h3>Or maybe you are interested in my IRC Bots?</h3>
					<p>
						Over the years, I've made many bots that connect to IRC, some sucked, but I still enjoyed making them.

						<a href="#not-yet-available">Eileen</a> | PHP | <a href="http://github.com/Westie/OUTRAGEbot/">OUTRAGEbot fork</a><br>
						<small>
							Eileen is my newest addition to the bot team; an all purpose utility bot

					</p>

						<a href="http://github.com/Zarthus/TwitchBot">TwitchBot</a> | PHP | <a href="http://github.com/Westie/OUTRAGEbot/">OUTRAGEbot fork</a><br>
						<small>
							TwitchBot was an IRC bot that connects to twitch.tv, it was made to log content from TwitchPlaysPok√©mon.
						</small>
					</p>

					<p>
						<a href="#source-code-hidden" class="col_red">_404</a> | PHP | Source Code Not Public<br>
						<small>
							_404 was my first PHP bot - it was pretty ugly and full of security issues, hence it's code is not public.
						</small>
					</p>

					<p>
						<a href="#source-code-lost" class="col_red">Convict</a> | mIRC | Source Code Lost<br>
						<small>
							Convict was an all utility mIRC bot that had a lot of functions, like my Games System.
							I'd imagine some of its functions are on <a href="https://github.com/Zarthus/Code-Snippets/tree/master/mSL%20-%20mIRC%20scripting%20language">GitHub</a> now, but it's core is gone forever.
