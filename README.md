## What is this?
This is zarth.us, a website I made by and for myself.  
I wanted to focus on documenting my code properly, and generally try out all kinds of open source utilities more popular projects have.

## Cool, what can I do with it?
Honestly, as it was so strongly designed for myself, I assume that you won't have a lot of use of it, but you're free to take a look, contribute, give constructive critique, or whatever you feel like doing.

## Contributing
I appreciate all kinds of comments, bug reports, critique, and code submissions.

## Installing
